# Bayesian Optimization Tutorial using Botorch
Notebooks demonstrating Gaussian Process modeling and Bayesian optimization

`gaussian_process.ipynb` demonstrates the creation of Gaussian Process models using Botorch.

`bo_example_stepped.ipynb` demostrates and visualizes a simple 1D optimization problem solved with Bayesian optimization using Botorch.

For more advanced usage without the hassle I suggest you check out `Xopt` https://github.com/ChristopherMayes/Xopt which implements a variety of Bayesian optimization algorithms and more.
